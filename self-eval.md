# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

I felt confident in my abilities going through this exercise. I definitely had to look some things up but it was never too difficult to figure something out except the is_adult is_old challenge on the hobbit class. I'm going to have to search a little harder for that
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

I think my workflow is going really well I'm just taking breaks after I try things a few times and hit a wall. I will take a five minute break and when I come back the answer is usually there for me
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?

I learned to trust myself and my intuition!
